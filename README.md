# Credit Card Fraud Detection
Objectives:
The primary objective of the project was to develop an efficient system capable
of identifying and preventing fraudulent transactions in real-time. Additionally,
the project aimed to enhance the security measures surrounding credit card
usage, thereby safeguarding the financial interests of both cardholders and
financial institutions.
Methods:
The project utilized a combination of machine learning algorithms and data
analysis techniques to achieve its objectives. Initially, historical transaction
data were collected and preprocessed to extract relevant features. Subsequently,
various machine learning models such as logistic regression, random forests,
and neural networks were trained on this data to classify transactions as either
legitimate or fraudulent. Feature engineering and selection techniques were
employed to improve model performance and efficiency. Moreover, the system
was integrated into the existing credit card processing infrastructure to enable
real-time monitoring and decision-making.
